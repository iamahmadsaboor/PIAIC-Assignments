          Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I am a dedicated Meta Certified Front End Developer with
          over a year of experience in web development. Currently studying at
          the University of Agriculture Faisalabad and diving into AI through
          PIAIC (Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence &
          Computing). My journey in web development began with HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript, allowing me to craft static web pages. Exploring deeper, I
          mastered frameworks like React for dynamic, interactive interfaces.
          I&apos; ve used Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS to create responsive, sleek
          websites adaptable to diverse devices. Through various front-end
          projects, I&apos; ve refined my technical skills and gained a keen eye
          for UI/UX design principles. Passionate about continuous learning,
          I&apos; m eager to merge my skills to craft beautiful, intuitive user
          experiences. AI has broadened my horizons, blending web development
          with artificial intelligence. Excited to share my projects and
          experiences! Feel free to connect for questions or collaborations.
          Let&apos; s create awesome digital experiences together! ðŸ˜Šâœ¨
